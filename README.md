This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory outside of the allocated array bounds.  The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to read from a memory location beyond the array's allocated space. This can lead to a segmentation fault or unpredictable behavior. The `bugSolution.asm` file shows a corrected version of the code with proper bounds checking.
